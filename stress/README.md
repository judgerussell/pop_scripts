# pop_scripts

This is a collection of scripts used in the project of interdiscplinarily annotating pop songs' vocal tracks, with linguistic and musical information done at UMass Amherst and Mount Holyoke College with Joe Pater, Christopher White, Mara Breen, and Joey Ball ... and probably more people in the future. They're all written in either Python or the Praat scripting language (Praat is what we use to annotate the tracks), and are sorted by purpose.

All code is written by myself with the exception of a few things which are by Kristine Yu and Andrew Lamont of UMass Amherst and Mietta Lennes of UCLA and edited by me. 

In the stress section, the function words list is a pared down version of the one available (as of October 30th 2020) on (https://www.sequencepublishing.com/1/), where I have removed every word that is more than one syllable. The singing words list is created by me, containing every nonsense singing word that appeared in the 25 songs I annotated, and definitely should be expanded!
